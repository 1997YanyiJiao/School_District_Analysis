The average scores in math and reading fell,the math passing rate, the reading passing rate, and the overall passing rate had droped after the change. 
## How is the school summary affected?
As the result of removing the Thomas High Shool ninth-grade scores, the school summary was affected, both the passing math percentage  and the passing reading percentage dropped, and the overall passing percentage fell as well.
## Replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores with NaN resulted in the following changes for Thomas High School:
The overall passing percentage for Thomas High School fell

The overall passing percentage for the entire district fell

Thomas High School's ranking in top schools dropped

we've found that Average Scores and Passing Percentages do not increase as spending per student increases.It does not match the idea of with more funding each students would do better in grades,  This implies that there are more relevant factors other than funding that decide average student scores

  As we can see above, the Large schools have the lowest passing percentage and small, Medium schools by size, they have much better rate of passing. And if we look at these schools by type, it is correct to say that the Charter schools have better passing percentage and grades over all by large margin than District schools
